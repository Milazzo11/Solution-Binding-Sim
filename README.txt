Run "bindsim.py" to start the currently configured simulation --
1 mol solute (Na+ ions), 10 mol solvent (H2O) in 100x100x100 nm space,
testing for binding to molecule of same size as solute in upper corner of
simulation space; solution molecular updates are set to occur every 1e-9
seconds, and 10 simultaneous simulations are set to run using multiprocessing.

All final data will appear in the "simdata" folder.

All simulation parameters listed above are configurable to adjust for different
environments and goals.
